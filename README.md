# Background

This tutorial follows on from "Species Trees with Relaxed Molecular Clocks",
and walks through how to set up a calibrated species tree analysis in
StarBEAST2. This sort of analysis enables researchers to estimate divergence
times for pairs of species, crown and stem groups, /et cetera/.
